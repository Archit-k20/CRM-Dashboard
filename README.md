CRM project — step-by-step plan, best tech stack options, and how it maps to the Amazon BA role Nice pick — a CRM project is perfect for showing SQL, data modeling, dashboards and business metrics. Below is a practical, actionable plan you can follow end-to-end (no fluff), two recommended tech stacks (one analytics-first, one full-stack), a relational schema you can copy, helpful SQL queries/KPIs, and exactly what to show on your resume / demo to match that Amazon internship. Best tech stacks (pick one) A. Analytics-first (fast, most relevant to Business Analyst role) — Use this if you want to highlight SQL + dashboards + analysis. Database: MySQL ETL / analysis: Python (pandas) Dashboard / front end: Streamlit or Tableau / Power BI (Tableau/PowerBI is great for hiring managers who value BI tools) Hosting: Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / Tableau Public Version control / CI: GitHub + GitHub Actions (basic) Why: shows SQL + Excel/pandas workflow and BI skills recruiters want. Step-by-step procedure (follow in order) Define scope & KPIs (one page) Entities: Customers, Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Activities Minimum features: CRUD for entities, import CSV, reporting dashboard (KPIs), search & filters, CSV export KPIs to track: New leads/week, Lead → Opportunity conversion rate, Pipeline value by stage, Avg time in stage, Win rate, Top sources by conversion. Design the relational schema Draft tables, PKs, FKs (see schema below). Keep schema normalized (3NF) for analytics queries. Decide on required fields and date fields (created_at, updated_at, stage_entered_at). Create dev environment and repo Initialize Git repo, setup branches (main, dev). Add README with project goal, stack, how to run locally. Create .env.example for DB credentials. Implement DB + seed data Create MySQL DB locally (or use Supabase for hosted DB). Create tables (SQL script provided below). Seed with synthetic data (generate with Python faker or use an open dataset) — ~1–10k rows to make charts meaningful. Build backend API or query layer Implement endpoints for: create/read/update/delete leads/customers/opportunities, bulk import, and analytics endpoints (e.g., /api/metrics/pipeline, /api/metrics/conversion). If analytics-first, you can skip a full backend and query DB directly from Streamlit / Tableau. Implement core UI & dashboards Dashboard should include: KPI tiles, time-series (new leads/week), funnel/conversion chart, pipeline value by stage, table for recent activities, filters (date range, source, owner). Provide export buttons (CSV/PDF). Add business features Lead scoring (simple rule-based), automated stage movement, activity logging. CSV import for leads (validate and deduplicate). Access control & roles Sales rep, Manager, Admin — restrict views (managers see aggregated KPIs). Instrument analytics + tests Add example SQL queries, unit tests for backend routes, and basic integration tests. Log slow queries; add indexing on commonly filtered columns (created_at, owner_id, stage). Deployment & demo Deploy dashboard and backend, host sample DB or snapshot, add a live demo link in README. Record a 2–3 min walkthrough video showing how you use the dashboard to answer business questions. Write a case study / README Describe dataset, business questions, approach, SQL snippets, findings, and business impact (if simulated, state assumptions). Add screenshots and sample queries. Resume / interview prep Add 2–3 crisp bullets for resume (templates below). Prepare to explain: the schema decisions, 3 SQL queries you used, and 2 business insights you found. Follow this step by step and give me full copy paste codes and how do i proceed. Give proper steps from beginning to end. Give proper paths wherever required
